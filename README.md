💫 Hi, I'm Chayn ^^
Welcome to my GitHub!

🚀 About Me:

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast from France, passionate about penetration testing and continuously sharpening my skills through personal projects and challenges. Currently preparing for the OSCP certification, I aim to deepen my expertise in offensive security and ethical hacking while sharing my journey and progress.

Through my projects, I explore various aspects of pentesting, including network security, web application vulnerabilities, and exploit development, utilizing tools like OpenVAS, Metasploit, Nmap, and more.
